                A gymnasium, also known as a gym, is a covered location for athletics.The word is derived
                from the ancient Greek term "gymnasium". They are commonly found in athletic and fitness 
                centres, and as activity and learning spaces in educational institutions. "Gym" is also 
                slang for "fitness centre", which is often an area for indoor recreation.In many European 
                countries, Gymnasium also can describe a secondary school that prepares students for higher
                education at a university,with or without the presence of athletic courts, fields, or equipment.
